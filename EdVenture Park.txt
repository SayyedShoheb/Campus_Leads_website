EdVenture Park is a student-focused idea stage startup incubator which aims to empower student led startups through an intensive 4 month pre Incubation programme. This pre incubation programme is specially curated for students and as per their schedule.

Any student having an entrepreneurial idea can apply for the Pre Incubation Program at EdVenture Park where we will be working with those student entrepreneurs, taking them through the fundamental tracks of building a company, organising exclusive sessions/workshops and giving them all the support & guidance they need for them to take their idea to the next level. Students can experiment with their ideas and have an opportunity of starting their own company while still in college.
